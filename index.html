          <p>The young association of biotechnology students SCTCE was established in 2014, with the basic objective of empowering students of biotechnology, through creation of a conductive environment for them to exress their basic basic skill sets as well as to aid them in developing new skills which could help them in fullfilling their commitment towards the society by pursuing a fullfilling career in the area of Biotechnology and to aid them in spreading the spirit of Biotechnology so as to take this vererable discipline to newer heights in the days ahead.</p>
					<p>EVOGEN was able to successfully conduct National Science Day Celebrations, Ozone Celebrations, etc by arranging events like bio quizzes, poster presentation, expert lectures and workshops using the fund sanctioned by <strong>Kerala State Council for Science Technology and Environment (KSCTSE)</strong>. We were also able to organise a National level symposium <strong>Equilibria 2016</strong> on Advances in Biosciences &amp; Bioengineering and <strong>Equilibria 2017</strong> on Trends &amp; prospects in Bio-Science and Technology towards Sustainability</p>

              <p>The third installment aims at bringing together the innovaative ideas of young individual in the field of product designing and entrepreneuship. We provide the ideal platform for presenting newly designed or revides bioproducts and related technological processes, that assure the enhancement of sciences and economic development. This theme has been expanded to bring together all engineering and bio-science streams, capable of contributing to biproduct development; be it designing models, algorithms, software, or instruments<br>This rendition of Equilibria also caters on effective intercommunication between studens ans established entrepreneurs, regarding the initiatory link between designing and developing bioproducts. Intending to encourage the development of modern sciences, and creating technological correction, Equilibria 2018 is an inceptive for associating erudition with the economic biz.</p>
